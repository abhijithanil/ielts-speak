### Method 1: Direct Configuration (Recommended)

Edit `frontend/src/utils/config.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  // Change this line to switch environments
  environment: 'dev', // Change to 'prod' for production
  
  // Question timer settings (in seconds)
  questionTimers: {
    part1: 30, // 30 seconds for Part 1 questions
    part2: 120, // 2 minutes for Part 2 cue card
    part3: 45, // 45 seconds for Part 3 questions
  },
  
  // Skip functionality settings
  allowSkip: true, // Set to false for production
  
  // Auto-submit when timer runs out
  autoSubmitOnTimeUp: true,
};
```

### Method 2: Environment Variables

Create environment files in the frontend directory:

**For Development:**
```bash
# frontend/.env.development
VITE_APP_ENV=dev
```

**For Production:**
```bash
# frontend/.env.production
VITE_APP_ENV=prod
```
